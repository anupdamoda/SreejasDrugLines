 	<div class="faqAnswers Website Ans5">Our process is very straightforward and transparent. Once you contact us, we will call you for a chat so we can understand you and what your needs are. Once we have all the information we need, we will send you a detailed proposal for your new website.

If you accept our proposal and pay the initial deposit we then get straight to work wireframing your new website, during which time you will provide us with the content you would like included. We then workshop our initial design with you so you can provide feedback and any required changes for us to make. This feedback and change process may occur more than once depending on the size and complexity of your website.

Once the design is finalised, we then fully test and launch the website and provide you with a handover pack. At this time you pay the remaining balance and we then activate your pre-selected monthly website support package.</div>
